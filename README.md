🚀 Employee Productivity Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview
This project presents a machine learning solution to predict employee productivity levels (Low, Average, High) using structured workplace data. The solution uses a Random Forest Classifier and addresses class imbalance with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique). The final model is deployed as an interactive Flask web application, allowing users to input employee data and receive productivity predictions in real time.

🧠 Problem Statement
Organizations often struggle to identify factors that influence employee performance. This project aims to help HR and management teams predict productivity based on various features such as work experience, hours worked, training scores, and more — enabling data-driven decisions for workforce optimization.
